You're right. To configure Prometheus scraping in a Kubernetes environment, it's better to use annotations on deployments or services. Here’s a corrected step-by-step guide including this approach:

1. Update pom.xml in Your Spring Boot Application
Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies for Micrometer and Prometheus in your pom.xml:

xml
Copy code
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
    <artifactId>micrometer-registry-prometheus</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
    <artifactId>micrometer-core</artifactId>
</dependency>
2. Configure Prometheus in Your Spring Boot Application
Add the Prometheus configuration in your application.properties:

properties
Copy code
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*
management.endpoint.prometheus.enabled=true
management.metrics.export.prometheus.enabled=true
management.metrics.export.prometheus.rsocket.enabled=false
3. Deploy Your Spring Boot Application with Prometheus Annotations
Ensure your Kubernetes deployment or service has the Prometheus annotations to enable metrics scraping.

Example deployment configuration (deployment.yaml):

yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: spring-boot-app
  labels:
    app: spring-boot-app
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: spring-boot-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: spring-boot-app
      annotations:
        prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
        prometheus.io/path: "/actuator/prometheus"
        prometheus.io/port: "8080"
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: spring-boot-app
        image: your-image
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
4. Set Up Prometheus
Ensure Prometheus is configured to scrape metrics from your annotated services.

Example prometheus.yml configuration:

yaml
Copy code
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'kubernetes-pods'
    kubernetes_sd_configs:
      - role: pod
    relabel_configs:
      - action: labelmap
        regex: __meta_kubernetes_pod_label_(.+)
      - action: replace
        source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_namespace]
        target_label: namespace
      - action: replace
        source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_name]
        target_label: pod
      - action: keep
        source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_annotation_prometheus_io_scrape]
        regex: true
      - action: replace
        source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_annotation_prometheus_io_path]
        target_label: __metrics_path__
        regex: (.+)
        replacement: ${1}
      - action: replace
        source_labels: [__address__, __meta_kubernetes_pod_annotation_prometheus_io_port]
        target_label: __address__
        regex: (.+):(?:\d+);(.+)
        replacement: ${1}:${2}
5. Deploy Prometheus Adapter
Deploy the Prometheus Adapter to expose custom metrics to the Kubernetes API.

a. Clone the Prometheus Adapter repository:
sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/prometheus-adapter.git
cd prometheus-adapter
b. Deploy using Kustomize:
sh
Copy code
kustomize build deploy/manifests | kubectl apply -f -
6. Configure the Prometheus Adapter
Configure the Prometheus Adapter to use your custom metrics. Edit the configuration file config.yaml:

yaml
Copy code
rules:
  custom:
    - seriesQuery: 'jvm_threads_live_threads'
      resources:
        overrides:
          namespace: {resource: "namespace"}
          pod: {resource: "pod"}
      name:
        matches: "^(.*)_total$"
        as: "${1}_per_second"
      metricsQuery: 'sum(rate(jvm_threads_live_threads[2m])) by (namespace, pod)'
7. Deploy and Configure HPA
Create an HPA configuration to use the custom metric. Example hpa.yaml:

yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: spring-boot-hpa
  namespace: default
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: spring-boot-deployment
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
  - type: Pods
    pods:
      metric:
        name: jvm_threads_live_threads
      target:
        type: AverageValue
        averageValue: 100
8. Apply the HPA Configuration
sh
Copy code
kubectl apply -f hpa.yaml
This setup ensures that your Spring Boot application metrics are exposed correctly to Prometheus and available for the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler to use for scaling decisions based on custom metrics.

For further details, you can refer to the Prometheus Adapter documentation and the Kubernetes Fury Distribution documentation.

Deployment YAML Example
Here is how you can annotate your Kubernetes deployment for Prometheus scraping:

yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: spring-boot-app
  labels:
    app: spring-boot-app
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: spring-boot-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: spring-boot-app
      annotations:
        prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
        prometheus.io/path: "/actuator/prometheus"
        prometheus.io/port: "8080"
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: spring-boot-app
        image: your-image
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
Prometheus Adapter Configuration
Here’s an example configuration for the Prometheus Adapter to use custom metrics:

yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: custom-metrics-config
  namespace: custom-metrics
data:
  config.yaml: |
    rules:
      custom:
        - seriesQuery: 'jvm_threads_live_threads'
          resources:
            overrides:
              namespace: {resource: "namespace"}
              pod: {resource: "pod"}
          name:
            matches: "^(.*)_total$"
            as: "${1}_per_second"
          metricsQuery: 'sum(rate(jvm_threads_live_threads[2m])) by (namespace, pod)'
Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) YAML Example
yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: spring-boot-hpa
  namespace: default
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: spring-boot-deployment
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
  - type: Pods
    pods:
      metric:
        name: jvm_threads_live_threads
      target:
        type: AverageValue
        averageValue: 100
Applying the Configurations
Apply your deployment and HPA configurations using kubectl:

sh
Copy code
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f hpa.yaml
This configuration will ensure that your Spring Boot application's metrics are correctly exposed to Prometheus, which in turn allows the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler to use these custom metrics to scale your application pods as needed.

Can you expantiate on why we have to load the query to the Prometheus adapter 
ChatGPT
The Prometheus Adapter is used to expose custom metrics to the Kubernetes API server, allowing these metrics to be used by the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA). Here’s a detailed explanation of why we need to load the query to the Prometheus Adapter:

1. Enabling Custom Metrics for HPA
Kubernetes’ HPA by default can scale based on CPU and memory usage using the metrics-server. However, to scale based on custom metrics like application-specific metrics (e.g., number of requests per second, queue length, etc.), you need to provide these metrics in a way that HPA can understand.

2. Prometheus Adapter Role
The Prometheus Adapter acts as a bridge between Prometheus (which collects and stores metrics) and the Kubernetes API server. It transforms Prometheus metrics into the custom metrics format that the Kubernetes HPA can use.

3. Configuration of Metrics Queries
To make Prometheus metrics available to the HPA, the Prometheus Adapter needs to know how to query these metrics. This is done through a configuration file (usually config.yaml). In this file, you define the series of queries that the adapter should execute on Prometheus to retrieve the necessary metrics.

Example of Configuration
Here’s an example configuration snippet:

yaml
Copy code
rules:
  custom:
    - seriesQuery: 'jvm_threads_live_threads'
      resources:
        overrides:
          namespace: {resource: "namespace"}
          pod: {resource: "pod"}
      name:
        matches: "^(.*)_total$"
        as: "${1}_per_second"
      metricsQuery: 'sum(rate(jvm_threads_live_threads[2m])) by (namespace, pod)'
In this example:

seriesQuery specifies the raw metric name in Prometheus.
resources define how the Kubernetes resource labels map to the Prometheus labels.
name specifies how to transform the Prometheus metric names into Kubernetes metric names.
metricsQuery defines the actual Prometheus query to execute.
4. Making Metrics Available in the Cluster
Once the Prometheus Adapter is configured and deployed, it continuously queries Prometheus for the metrics defined in the configuration file and exposes these metrics to the Kubernetes metrics API. The HPA can then retrieve these custom metrics via the Kubernetes API server.

5. Dynamic Scaling
With the Prometheus Adapter in place, you can define HPA policies that scale your deployments based on these custom metrics. This allows for more sophisticated and application-specific scaling strategies compared to just CPU and memory usage.

Benefits
Scalability: Enables scaling decisions based on more relevant metrics for your application.
Flexibility: Supports complex metrics queries and transformations.
Integration: Seamlessly integrates with existing Prometheus setups, leveraging its powerful querying capabilities.

Horizontal Pod Autoscaler Using Custom Metrics
Can you explain the current query that you gave me above?
ChatGPT
Certainly! Let's break down the Prometheus Adapter configuration query I provided:

yaml
Copy code
rules:
  custom:
    - seriesQuery: 'jvm_threads_live_threads'
      resources:
        overrides:
          namespace: {resource: "namespace"}
          pod: {resource: "pod"}
      name:
        matches: "^(.*)_total$"
        as: "${1}_per_second"
      metricsQuery: 'sum(rate(jvm_threads_live_threads[2m])) by (namespace, pod)'
Explanation of the Query Configuration
seriesQuery
This field specifies the Prometheus time series that you want to use. In this case, it is:

yaml
Copy code
seriesQuery: 'jvm_threads_live_threads'
This indicates that we are querying the jvm_threads_live_threads metric, which represents the number of live threads in the JVM.

resources
This section defines how to map Kubernetes resource labels to Prometheus labels. In this example:

yaml
Copy code
resources:
  overrides:
    namespace: {resource: "namespace"}
    pod: {resource: "pod"}
namespace and pod are being mapped from Kubernetes resource labels to Prometheus labels. This is necessary for the adapter to correlate the metrics correctly with the Kubernetes resources.
name
This part specifies how to transform the metric names. The configuration here:

yaml
Copy code
name:
  matches: "^(.*)_total$"
  as: "${1}_per_second"
matches: This regex captures any metric ending in _total.
as: This uses the captured group (anything before _total) and appends _per_second to it. Essentially, it renames metrics to follow a specific convention, indicating that the metric is a rate.
metricsQuery
This field contains the actual Prometheus query to calculate the metric. Here’s the breakdown:

yaml
Copy code
metricsQuery: 'sum(rate(jvm_threads_live_threads[2m])) by (namespace, pod)'
rate(jvm_threads_live_threads[2m]): This calculates the rate of change for jvm_threads_live_threads over a 2-minute window.
sum(rate(jvm_threads_live_threads[2m])) by (namespace, pod): This sums up the rate of change for jvm_threads_live_threads grouped by the namespace and pod. The result is the total rate of change of live threads per second for each pod within each namespace.
Purpose of Each Section
seriesQuery: Identifies the Prometheus metric you are interested in.
resources: Maps the Prometheus metric labels to Kubernetes resource labels.
name: Provides a naming convention for the metrics.
metricsQuery: Defines the specific Prometheus query to execute, transforming raw metrics into a form that can be used by Kubernetes for scaling decisions.
Why This Configuration?
This configuration is designed to enable the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to scale based on the number of live threads in the JVM. By converting the jvm_threads_live_threads metric into a rate, it allows the HPA to make more dynamic scaling decisions based on the rate of change of live threads, which can be a more responsive metric compared to static thread count.

Summary
Prometheus Adapter: Bridges Prometheus and Kubernetes, exposing custom metrics.
Configuration: Defines which metrics to query and how to present them to Kubernetes.
HPA Integration: Uses these custom metrics for autoscaling decisions.
This setup provides a flexible and powerful way to use detailed application metrics for scaling decisions, ensuring that your application can automatically adjust its resource usage based on real-time performance data.

Show me equally promsql
ChatGPT
Sure! Let's break down the Prometheus query (PromQL) used in the Prometheus Adapter configuration and explain each part.

Original PromQL Query
yaml
Copy code
sum(rate(jvm_threads_live_threads[2m])) by (namespace, pod)
Explanation of the PromQL Query
rate(jvm_threads_live_threads[2m]):

Function: rate()
This function calculates the per-second average rate of increase of a counter over a specified time window.
Metric: jvm_threads_live_threads
This is the metric being queried, which represents the number of live threads in the JVM.
Time Window: [2m]
This specifies the time window for the rate calculation, in this case, 2 minutes.
sum(rate(jvm_threads_live_threads[2m])):

Function: sum()
This aggregates the results of the rate() function.
Aggregation:
The sum() function is used to aggregate the rates of the jvm_threads_live_threads metric over the specified time window. This means it will sum up the rates across all instances of the metric.
by (namespace, pod):

Grouping: by (namespace, pod)
This specifies the dimensions over which to perform the aggregation.
Dimensions: namespace and pod
This means the aggregation will be performed for each unique combination of namespace and pod labels. Essentially, the rate is summed up for each pod within each namespace.
Breaking Down Each Part
Metric (jvm_threads_live_threads):

Represents the current number of live threads in the JVM. This metric is collected from your Spring Boot application using Micrometer and exposed to Prometheus.
Function (rate()):

Calculates the average rate of change per second over a specified time window. The [2m] indicates that the rate should be calculated over a 2-minute window. This is useful for understanding the trend of the metric over time, rather than just the current value.
Aggregation (sum()):

Aggregates the rate values to provide a single value per specified dimension. In this case, it sums the rate of jvm_threads_live_threads for each pod within each namespace.
Grouping (by (namespace, pod)):

Groups the aggregated results by the namespace and pod labels. This means the result will show the aggregated rate for each pod in each namespace, which helps in monitoring and autoscaling decisions at the pod level within specific namespaces.
Example Prometheus Console Output
When you run this query in the Prometheus console, you might see results like this:

arduino
Copy code
{namespace="default", pod="spring-boot-app-12345"}    0.5
{namespace="default", pod="spring-boot-app-67890"}    0.7
These results indicate the per-second rate of increase in the number of live JVM threads for each pod within the default namespace.

Usage in HPA
By using this PromQL query in the Prometheus Adapter configuration, you expose the rate of change of live JVM threads to the Kubernetes metrics API. The HPA can then use this custom metric to make more informed scaling decisions based on the actual load and performance characteristics of your application.

This approach ensures that your application scales dynamically in response to real-time workload changes, improving resource utilization and maintaining performance.

For more detailed information on PromQL, you can refer to the Prometheus documentation.

Can you add specify pod name or labels in the query to absolute for promsql alone. Don’t regenerate the adapter config . It doesn’t add value to have pod name in actual adapter because it has to be reusable cluster wide

2/2

ChatGPT
Certainly! To specify a particular pod name or label in your PromQL query, you can use the = operator within curly braces to filter the metrics. Here’s how you can modify the query to include specific pod names or labels:

PromQL Query with Specific Pod Name
Suppose you want to filter metrics for a specific pod named spring-boot-app-12345:

promql
Copy code
sum(rate(jvm_threads_live_threads{pod="spring-boot-app-12345"}[2m])) by (namespace, pod)
PromQL Query with Specific Labels
If you want to filter based on other labels, for instance, a label app with value spring-boot-app, the query would be:

promql
Copy code
sum(rate(jvm_threads_live_threads{app="spring-boot-app"}[2m])) by (namespace, pod)
Explanation
Filter by Pod Name

promql
Copy code
jvm_threads_live_threads{pod="spring-boot-app-12345"}
This part of the query filters the metrics to include only those from the pod named spring-boot-app-12345.

Filter by Label

promql
Copy code
jvm_threads_live_threads{app="spring-boot-app"}
This filters the metrics to include only those that have the label app set to spring-boot-app.

Aggregation and Rate Calculation
The rest of the query remains the same, performing rate calculation and summing up the results:

promql
Copy code
sum(rate(jvm_threads_live_threads[2m])) by (namespace, pod)
Putting It Together
Here is the complete query filtering by a specific pod name:

promql
Copy code
sum(rate(jvm_threads_live_threads{pod="spring-boot-app-12345"}[2m])) by (namespace, pod)
And here is the query filtering by a specific label:

promql
Copy code
sum(rate(jvm_threads_live_threads{app="spring-boot-app"}[2m])) by (namespace, pod)
These queries ensure that you only get metrics for the specified pod or label, which can be useful for debugging or monitoring specific components of your application.

Use Case
While the Prometheus Adapter configuration should remain reusable across the cluster without specific pod names, these PromQL queries are useful for ad-hoc analysis or creating specific monitoring dashboards in Prometheus or Grafana. For example, if you notice an issue with a particular pod, you can run these queries to isolate metrics and investigate further.

What about pod name with wild card 
ChatGPT
In Prometheus, you can use regular expressions to filter metrics based on patterns in label values. This is useful if you want to filter pods by name using wildcards.

PromQL Query with Wildcard for Pod Name
To match pod names using a wildcard, you can use the =~ operator and a regular expression. For example, to match all pods whose names start with spring-boot-app, you can use the following query:

promql
Copy code
sum(rate(jvm_threads_live_threads{pod=~"spring-boot-app.*"}[2m])) by (namespace, pod)
Explanation
Filter by Pod Name with Wildcard

promql
Copy code
jvm_threads_live_threads{pod=~"spring-boot-app.*"}
This part of the query uses a regular expression to match all pods whose names start with spring-boot-app. The .* is a regular expression that matches any sequence of characters following spring-boot-app.

Aggregation and Rate Calculation
The rest of the query remains the same:

promql
Copy code
sum(rate(jvm_threads_live_threads[2m])) by (namespace, pod)
Putting It Together
Here is the complete query:

promql
Copy code
sum(rate(jvm_threads_live_threads{pod=~"spring-boot-app.*"}[2m])) by (namespace, pod)
Use Case
Using wildcards is useful when you have multiple pods with similar naming conventions and you want to aggregate metrics for all of them. For instance, if your application scales out multiple instances of spring-boot-app pods, this query allows you to monitor and analyze metrics across all instances without specifying each pod individually.

Example Regular Expression Filters
Match Pods Starting with spring-boot-app:
promql
Copy code
jvm_threads_live_threads{pod=~"spring-boot-app.*"}
Match Pods Ending with -12345:
promql
Copy code
jvm_threads_live_threads{pod=~".*-12345"}
Match Pods Containing test:
promql
Copy code
jvm_threads_live_threads{pod=~".*test.*"}
Summary
Using regular expressions in PromQL queries provides a powerful way to filter metrics based on patterns in label values. This is particularly useful for dynamically named resources in a Kubernetes environment, allowing for more flexible and comprehensive monitoring and analysis.


I ran the query and the result were fractional. I don’t think this is easy to be used for hpa. Why can we use query in the screen shot? 
ChatGPT
The query in your screenshot (sum by (app, namespace) (jvm_threads_live_threads)) is indeed a valid and simpler query. This query aggregates the total number of live JVM threads by application (app) and namespace, which can be useful for monitoring but might not be directly suitable for HPA if it produces fractional results due to averaging over multiple pods.

To make it more suitable for HPA, where integer values are generally preferred, especially if you want to make decisions based on discrete values, you might want to use the raw count without averaging over time. Here’s a refined version of the query to get a more stable metric:

PromQL Query for HPA
If you want to sum the live threads per application and namespace:

promql
Copy code
sum(jvm_threads_live_threads) by (app, namespace)
Explanation
sum(jvm_threads_live_threads):
This sums up the total live threads across all instances.
by (app, namespace):
This groups the summed results by application and namespace.
This query will give you a total count of live JVM threads for each application within each namespace. This is simpler and more straightforward for HPA to consume compared to the rate of change, which might be more complex and produce fractional results.

Using This Query for HPA
Prometheus Adapter Configuration:
Ensure your Prometheus Adapter is configured to handle the custom metric appropriately. You don’t need to change the configuration provided earlier if it’s already set up to query custom metrics.

HPA Configuration:
Update your HPA configuration to use this simplified metric. Example hpa.yaml:

yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: spring-boot-hpa
  namespace: default
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: spring-boot-deployment
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
  - type: Pods
    pods:
      metric:
        name: jvm_threads_live_threads
      target:
        type: AverageValue
        averageValue: 100
By using the total count of jvm_threads_live_threads grouped by app and namespace, the HPA can scale your application based on the actual number of live threads, providing a more intuitive and straightforward scaling metric.

This approach should give you more stable and actionable metrics for your HPA, avoiding fractional results and making the scaling logic simpler.

Now add the add label to the query for promql purposes
ChatGPT
To refine your PromQL query by adding a label filter, you can specify the desired label and value within curly braces. This helps in narrowing down the metrics to a specific subset based on the label value. Here’s how you can do it:

PromQL Query with Label Filtering
Example 1: Filter by Specific Pod Name
If you want to filter by a specific pod name, for example, spring-boot-app-12345, the query would be:

promql
Copy code
sum(jvm_threads_live_threads{pod="spring-boot-app-12345"}) by (app, namespace)
Example 2: Filter by a Specific Label
If you want to filter by a specific label, such as app with the value spring-boot-app, the query would be:

promql
Copy code
sum(jvm_threads_live_threads{app="spring-boot-app"}) by (namespace, pod)
Example 3: Use Wildcards with Regular Expressions
To filter by pod names that start with spring-boot-app, you can use a regular expression:

promql
Copy code
sum(jvm_threads_live_threads{pod=~"spring-boot-app.*"}) by (namespace, pod)
Explanation
Filter by Specific Pod Name

promql
Copy code
jvm_threads_live_threads{pod="spring-boot-app-12345"}
This part of the query filters the metrics to include only those from the pod named spring-boot-app-12345.

Filter by Specific Label

promql
Copy code
jvm_threads_live_threads{app="spring-boot-app"}
This filters the metrics to include only those that have the label app set to spring-boot-app.

Wildcard Filtering with Regular Expressions

promql
Copy code
jvm_threads_live_threads{pod=~"spring-boot-app.*"}
This uses a regular expression to match all pod names that start with spring-boot-app.

Aggregation and Grouping
The sum() function aggregates the values, and the by (namespace, pod) clause groups the results by the specified labels.

Example for Prometheus Console
If you run the following query in the Prometheus console, it will aggregate the jvm_threads_live_threads metrics filtered by the specified labels and group the results by namespace and pod:

promql
Copy code
sum(jvm_threads_live_threads{app="spring-boot-app"}) by (namespace, pod)
This query will return the sum of live JVM threads for each pod within the spring-boot-app application, grouped by namespace and pod.

Use Case
These refined queries are useful for:

Monitoring: Aggregating metrics for specific applications or pods.
Debugging: Isolating metrics for specific pods or applications to troubleshoot issues.
Alerting: Setting up specific alerts based on detailed label filtering.
By using these filtered queries, you can get more precise and actionable metrics from Prometheus, making it easier to monitor and scale your applications based on relevant data.

Can you add time to sum(jvm_threads_live_threads{app="spring-boot-app"}) by (namespace, pod)
ChatGPT
To add a time range to your PromQL query, you can use the sum_over_time function. This function sums the values of the specified metric over a given time range. Here's how you can modify your query to include a time range:

PromQL Query with Time Range
Example Query
If you want to sum the jvm_threads_live_threads metric over the past 5 minutes for the spring-boot-app, grouped by namespace and pod, the query would be:

promql
Copy code
sum_over_time(jvm_threads_live_threads{app="spring-boot-app"}[5m]) by (namespace, pod)
Explanation
Metric Filtering

promql
Copy code
jvm_threads_live_threads{app="spring-boot-app"}
This part filters the jvm_threads_live_threads metrics to include only those with the label app set to spring-boot-app.

Time Range

promql
Copy code
[5m]
This specifies the time range over which the sum is calculated, in this case, the past 5 minutes.

Function

promql
Copy code
sum_over_time()
This function sums the values of the specified metric over the given time range.

Grouping

promql
Copy code
by (namespace, pod)
This groups the summed results by namespace and pod.

Putting It All Together
Here is the complete query:

promql
Copy code
sum_over_time(jvm_threads_live_threads{app="spring-boot-app"}[5m]) by (namespace, pod)
Example for Prometheus Console
If you run the above query in the Prometheus console, it will return the sum of live JVM threads for each pod within the spring-boot-app application over the past 5 minutes, grouped by namespace and pod.

Use Case
Using sum_over_time helps in aggregating the metric values over a specific time period, providing a smoothed and time-bounded view of the data. This can be useful for:

Monitoring: Observing trends and patterns over a specific time frame.
Debugging: Identifying spikes or drops in metrics over recent history.
Alerting: Setting up alerts based on aggregated values over a certain period to avoid reacting to transient spikes.
By using this approach, you ensure that your monitoring and scaling logic is based on a more stable and aggregated view of the metric data, which can help in making more informed decisions.

Are you sure that this is valid
ChatGPT
You're right; I should have used a valid PromQL function for time-based aggregation. The correct approach is to use rate, irate, increase, or avg_over_time functions, which are designed to handle time ranges appropriately. Let's use increase in this context, which is suitable for counters like JVM thread metrics.

Corrected PromQL Query

Now show me the equivalent query needed for adapter 
ChatGPT
To configure the Prometheus Adapter to use the average number of JVM live threads over a 5-minute window, you need to define a custom metrics rule in the adapter's configuration. This involves specifying the PromQL query within the adapter’s config.yaml.

Here’s how to define this in the Prometheus Adapter configuration:

Prometheus Adapter Configuration
Edit the config.yaml: Add a new rule to query the average number of JVM live threads over 5 minutes.
yaml
Copy code
rules:
  custom:
    - seriesQuery: 'jvm_threads_live_threads'
      resources:
        overrides:
          namespace: {resource: "namespace"}
          pod: {resource: "pod"}
      name:
        matches: "^(.*)_total$"
        as: "${1}_average"
      metricsQuery: 'avg(avg_over_time(jvm_threads_live_threads[5m])) by (namespace, pod)'
Explanation
seriesQuery: 'jvm_threads_live_threads'

This specifies the Prometheus time series to query.
resources: Overrides for mapping Kubernetes resource labels to Prometheus labels.

namespace: Maps to the namespace resource.
pod: Maps to the pod resource.
name: Transformation of the metric name.

matches: Regex pattern to match metric names.
as: Transformation format for the matched metric name.
metricsQuery: 'avg(avg_over_time(jvm_threads_live_threads[5m])) by (namespace, pod)'

This defines the actual PromQL query to compute the average JVM live threads over a 5-minute window, grouped by namespace and pod.
Steps to Apply the Configuration
Update the config.yaml:
Ensure your config.yaml file in the Prometheus Adapter configuration includes the above rule.

Deploy the Prometheus Adapter:
Apply the updated configuration to your Kubernetes cluster.

sh
Copy code
kubectl apply -f path/to/prometheus-adapter/config.yaml
Verify the Metrics:
Ensure that the custom metric is available in the Kubernetes metrics API.

sh
Copy code
kubectl get --raw "/apis/custom.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1" | jq .
Configure HPA:
Create or update your HPA configuration to use the new custom metric.

yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: spring-boot-hpa
  namespace: default
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: spring-boot-deployment
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
  - type: Pods
    pods:
      metric:
        name: jvm_threads_live_threads_average
      target:
        type: AverageValue
        averageValue: 100
Summary
This configuration ensures that the Prometheus Adapter exposes the average number of JVM live threads over a 5-minute window as a custom metric. The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler can then use this custom metric to make scaling decisions based on the average JVM live threads, providing a more stable and meaningful basis for scaling compared to instantaneous values or rates.

Now show me the equivalent custom query needed for adapter . Make sure the right name of the custom query as used in the adapter is referenced in the HPA. Let me know if you understand by saying hi hi captain 
ChatGPT
Hi hi captain!

To configure the Prometheus Adapter to expose a custom metric for the average number of JVM live threads over a 5-minute window, and to ensure this custom metric is used correctly in the HPA, follow these steps:

1. Prometheus Adapter Configuration
Edit the config.yaml for the Prometheus Adapter to include a rule for the custom metric. Here's the configuration for the adapter:

yaml
Copy code
rules:
  custom:
    - seriesQuery: 'jvm_threads_live_threads'
      resources:
        overrides:
          namespace: {resource: "namespace"}
          pod: {resource: "pod"}
      name:
        matches: "jvm_threads_live_threads"
        as: "average_jvm_threads"
      metricsQuery: 'avg(avg_over_time(jvm_threads_live_threads[5m])) by (namespace, pod)'
Explanation
seriesQuery: 'jvm_threads_live_threads'

This specifies the Prometheus time series to query.
resources: Overrides for mapping Kubernetes resource labels to Prometheus labels.

namespace: Maps to the namespace resource.
pod: Maps to the pod resource.
name: Transformation of the metric name.

matches: This regex pattern matches the jvm_threads_live_threads metric name.
as: This transforms the matched metric name to average_jvm_threads.
metricsQuery: 'avg(avg_over_time(jvm_threads_live_threads[5m])) by (namespace, pod)'

This PromQL query calculates the average JVM live threads over a 5-minute window, grouped by namespace and pod.
2. Deploy the Prometheus Adapter Configuration
Apply the updated configuration to your Kubernetes cluster:

sh
Copy code
kubectl apply -f path/to/prometheus-adapter/config.yaml
3. Verify Custom Metrics
Ensure that the custom metric average_jvm_threads is available in the Kubernetes metrics API:

sh
Copy code
kubectl get --raw "/apis/custom.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/namespaces/default/pods/*/average_jvm_threads" | jq .
4. Configure HPA to Use the Custom Metric
Create or update your HPA configuration to reference the average_jvm_threads metric:

yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: spring-boot-hpa
  namespace: default
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: spring-boot-deployment
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
  - type: Pods
    pods:
      metric:
        name: average_jvm_threads
      target:
        type: AverageValue
        averageValue: 100
Summary
This setup ensures that the Prometheus Adapter exposes the custom metric average_jvm_threads, which calculates the average number of JVM live threads over a 5-minute window. The HPA is configured to use this custom metric for scaling decisions, referencing average_jvm_threads as defined in the adapter configuration. This approach provides a stable basis for autoscaling based on JVM live thread counts.

I need to understand the hpa well, does it mean that it aggregates metrics from all pods that belongs to that deployment and take their average value?
ChatGPT
The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) in Kubernetes is a mechanism that automatically scales the number of pods in a deployment, replica set, or stateful set based on observed metrics. Here's a detailed explanation of how it works, especially in the context of aggregating metrics from all pods in a deployment:

How HPA Works
Metrics Collection:

HPA collects metrics from all the pods that belong to the targeted deployment, replica set, or stateful set.
Metrics can include CPU utilization, memory usage, or custom metrics provided by Prometheus or other monitoring systems.
Aggregation of Metrics:

CPU/Memory Metrics: When using default metrics like CPU or memory, HPA calculates the average utilization across all pods.
Custom Metrics: When using custom metrics, HPA aggregates these metrics according to the type of metric specified (e.g., sum, average).
Example of CPU/Memory Metrics
When using CPU or memory metrics, HPA fetches the current usage of these resources from each pod and calculates the average utilization across all pods. For example, if you have a deployment with 3 pods and their CPU utilizations are 30%, 50%, and 70%, the HPA would calculate the average CPU utilization as:

Average CPU Utilization
=
30
%
+
50
%
+
70
%
3
=
50
%
Average CPU Utilization= 
3
30%+50%+70%
​
 =50%

Example of Custom Metrics
For custom metrics, the process is similar but depends on how the custom metric is defined. If you have defined a custom metric to average JVM live threads over a 5-minute window, HPA will fetch this metric from each pod, aggregate it (usually by averaging), and use this value to determine if scaling is necessary.

HPA Configuration Example
Here’s an example HPA configuration for scaling based on a custom metric:

yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: spring-boot-hpa
  namespace: default
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: spring-boot-deployment
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
  - type: Pods
    pods:
      metric:
        name: average_jvm_threads
      target:
        type: AverageValue
        averageValue: 100
Understanding the HPA Metrics Section
type: Pods: Indicates that this is a custom metric applied to pods.
metric.name: average_jvm_threads: The custom metric being used, as defined in the Prometheus Adapter.
target.type: AverageValue: Specifies that the HPA should use the average value of the metric across all pods.
target.averageValue: 100: The target average value that the HPA aims to maintain.
Aggregation Logic
The HPA continuously monitors the specified metric.
If the average value of the metric exceeds or falls below the target, the HPA adjusts the number of replicas accordingly. For instance, if the average JVM threads are higher than 100, it may scale out (increase the number of pods). Conversely, if the average is lower, it may scale in (decrease the number of pods).
Summary
HPA Aggregation: The HPA aggregates metrics from all pods in the deployment and typically uses the average value to make scaling decisions.
Metric Types: Works with CPU, memory, and custom metrics provided by monitoring systems like Prometheus.
Scaling Decision: Based on whether the aggregated metric meets or exceeds the specified target.
By understanding these principles, you can effectively configure and use HPA to ensure your applications scale dynamically based on real-time metrics, maintaining performance and efficiency. For further reading, refer to the Kubernetes documentation on HPA.
